# Write a function called specialmean that takes a positive integer n as input. Given this integer input, 
# calculate the mean value of the following list: [1,2,...,n,2**1,2**2,...,2**n].

# For example, specialmean(5) should return the mean value of the list [1,2,3,4,5,2,4,8,16,32], which is 7.7.
# Hint: To calculate the mean of a list, feel free to use Python's mean() function by adding the following line before your 
# function definition:  from statistics import mean

# If the input is not a positive integer, the function should return 0. 
# Hint: isinstance(n,int) returns True if n is an integer.

from statistics import mean

## Getting started
To get started, check that Python is installed in your shell:
```
python --version
```
or
```
python3 --version
```

If not, install it:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
*If the command throws an error, try with `apt-get` instead of `apt`*
